# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

A small, beginner-friendly project created as a learning exercise to practice and improve Python coding skills. The main focus of this project was to refactor and improve an initial implementation, making the code cleaner, more efficient, and in line with best programming practices.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was:
- To refactor old code for better structure and readability.
- To demonstrate continuous improvement and learning in Python programming.
- To showcase activity and growth on GitHub with a simple yet meaningful project.

## Project Summary
- The game asks the player to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
- Players can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard, which determine the number of allowed guesses.
- The game provides feedback on whether each guess is too high or too low until the player either guesses correctly or runs out of chances.

## Reflection
This project serves as a testament to the process of learning, improving, and refactoring code to align with best practices. It's a small step in building a portfolio that demonstrates coding growth and commitment to writing better software over time.
